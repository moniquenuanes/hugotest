<span class="fas fa-folder" aria-hidden=true></span>&nbsp;<a href=/categories/uncategorized/ rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a></p></header><p><strong>Batik Air (IATA code: ID)</strong> is known as the “new kid on the block”, because it was founded only in 2013. The first flight was operated in May 2013 from Jakarta to Manado. Batik Air is one of the subsidiaries of Lion Air, also a national low-cost carrier founded by PT Lion Mentari Airlines in 1999. With the slogan “Journey Begins”, Batik Air is committed to providing as many flight operations as it can, from domestic routes to international ones, such as Singapore, Australia, and India. The airline is determined to help passengers get to their destinations with the best flight service it can possibly offer. Today, Batik Air operates with 41 fleets, four times larger than when it first operated a few years ago. Now, Batik Air serves 226 flights daily. Listed under IARA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) since November 2016, Batik Air has met all requirements to operate international flights. These include flights to Kolkata, Chennai, and Mumbai, three of the biggest cities in India. Besides India and various cities in Indonesia, Batik Air also offers flights to Australia, China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. Back in January 2016, Batik Air received an IATA Standard Safety Assessment (ISSA) certificate. ISSA is an IATA Operational Safety Audit program, which performs audit to airline companies on several factors. Generally, those factors include organization system, management system, flight operation, aircraft and its machine maintenance, cabin and cargo, and operational safety. This certificate clearly shows that Batik Air had been recognized for its improvement in serving great quality service, resulting in the European Union (EU) lifting its ban on Batik Air and Lion Air to fly to any European country. This allows Batik Air to expand its flight routes, especially the international ones. Batik Air’s expansion plan is supported by the fact that the airline has a great On Time Performance (OTP) record. The airline has received a certificate awarding its punctuality, cementing their place at the top of the list of airlines with the best OTP. Batik Air has operated 23,366 on-time flights, which is 91% of the total flights it operates. The airline beats Nam Air and Garuda Indonesia, whose on-time flight percentage is 85% of their total flights. This proves that Batik Air is fully committed to giving the best flight service to all of its passengers. In operating its flight on a daily basis, Batik Air offers two types of flight classes, Economy Class and Business Class. Each Economy Class passenger is entitled to a complimentary baggage allowance of 20 kg and a maximum cabin baggage of 7 kg. The passengers’ comfort during the flight is guaranteed by a spacious 32-inch (around 81 cm) legroom at each Economy Class seat. Batik Air also provides in-flight entertainment with various contents, such as movies, music, and games. Passengers can access them through an LCD screen in front of their seat. Moreover, the Batik Air Economy Class is also equipped with USB and power outlets. On the other hand, the Batik Air Business Class comes with even more benefits. Passengers get not only a complimentary baggage allowance of 30 kg and a wider seat with a 45-inch (around 114 cm) legroom, but also an exclusive service including a priority check-in counter where they will be assisted by Batik Air personal ambassadors, who will help them during check-in, at immigration counter, and when they have other concerns. Once passengers are settled in their Business Class seats, they can enjoy in-flight entertainment featuring the most updated movies, music, and games, and charge their electronic devices using the provided USB port. Passengers departing from Terminal 1C Soekarno-Hatta International Airport have access to Batik Air Business Class Lounge, where they can relax, grab a drink, have a quick lunch, and squeeze in some work, thanks to the fast WiFi connection. They can also enjoy a great selection of entertainment, from television and newspapers, to magazines. Batik Air Lounge helps passengers feel refreshed before they continue their flight. To appreciate its loyal customers, Batik Air offers BatikMiles, a frequent flyer program with a bunch of exclusive privileges. BatikMiles members get to earn miles, which is redeemable for free flights and comes with exclusive rewards as well as exciting benefits and privileges offered by Batik Air’s partners. There are two membership tiers in BatikMiles, Batik Silver and Batik Gold, each offering different benefits. Batik Silver members can earn points from eligible flights, redeem miles for Award Ticket, redeem miles for Upgrade Award, and get their luggage tagged. Batik Gold members, on the other hand, get a complimentary additional baggage allowance of 10 kg, priority boarding, and seating preference in addition to the benefits offered to Batik Silver members. The BatikMiles membership is a lifetime membership, but the membership card is valid only for five years and miles earned are valid for 12 months from the date of accumulation. To join as a member of BatikMiles, passengers can visit miles.batikair.com and sign up for free. For Batik Air domestic flights, check-in starts from two hours prior to departure and closes 30 minutes before departure. This applies to passengers of all classes. Meanwhile for international flights, check-in starts from two hours prior to departure and closes 45 minutes before departure. This also applies to all classes of passengers. Passengers can also check-in online via Batik Air website. In order to maintain schedule, the boarding gate will be closed 15 minutes before departure time. Passengers who fail to report at the boarding gate at the requested boarding time will not be allowed to board the flight and will be considered as no-show.</p><hr><footer><section><h4>Share</h4><nav class="nav sharing-icons"><a class=nav-item href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpost%2ftiket-pesawat-trigana-air-harga-tiket-promo-trigana-air-di-traveloka%2f" title="Share on Facebook"><span class="fab fa-facebook-f fa-2x" aria-hidden=true></span></a>
